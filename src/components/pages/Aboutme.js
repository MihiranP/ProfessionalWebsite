As a creative and analytical person, computer science was a way for me to both express my artistic ability and satiate my need for order and logic. My interest areas in CS are data science/analysis, artificial intelligence, game development, and robotics. To further my familiarity on these topics and broaden my knowledge of computer science, I usually watch YouTube videos that I find interesting. Some of my favorite YouTubers are Code Bullet, Brackeys, Dani, The Coding Train, and Sebastian Lague."

As much as I love good movies and tv shows, I have yet to find any form of media that outshines the plot of a well-written book. I mainly listen to books in the fantasy genre some of my favorites being, The Name of the Wind, Wise Man’s Fear, Rage of Dragons, and you can never go wrong with the Harry Potter series. "
