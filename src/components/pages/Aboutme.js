As a creative and analytical person, computer science was a way for me to both express my artistic ability and satiate my need for order and logic. My interest areas in CS are data science/analysis, artificial intelligence, game development, and robotics. To further my familiarity on these topics and broaden my knowledge of computer science, I usually watch YouTube videos that I find interesting. Some of my favorite YouTubers are Code Bullet, Brackeys, Dani, The Coding Train, and Sebastian Lague."

As much as I love good movies and tv shows, I have yet to find any form of media that outshines the plot of a well-written book. I mainly listen to books in the fantasy genre some of my favorites being, The Name of the Wind, Wise Man’s Fear, Rage of Dragons, and I absolutely love the Harry Potter series. "
